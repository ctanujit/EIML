# EIML: Epidemic Informed Machine Learning

* This repository contains the code and datasets required for implementing the Epidemic Informed Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (EI-ARIMA) and Epidemic Informed Autoregressive Neural Networks (EI-ARNN) proposed in "Developing cholera outbreak forecasting through qualitative dynamics: Insights into Malawi case study".

* A schematic representation of epidemic-informed machine learning and statistical approach in the context of the epidemic knowledge and the use of the epidemic data size. An illustration of the EI-ARIMA and EI-ARNN models where the infection dynamics from the SIBR model is used as a covariate with the real-world cholera cases in the data science models to generate the forecasts is provided below:
